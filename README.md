This project automates the process of verifying whether a website belongs to an eligible digital agency based on predefined criteria. The system scrapes website content, checks for relevant keywords, and leverages AI (Groq's LLaMA 3 model) to determine whether the site qualifies as an agency.

The final decision—"Approved" or "Rejected"—is stored in a CSV file, along with identified keywords.
